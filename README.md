# lowest-common-multiple
✖️ My solution to an Edabit challenge to calculate the lowest common multiple of a pair of numbers, e.g. lcm(12, 15) => 60.

🧮 My solution includes functions for checking a number is prime, generating the prime factors of a number, and merging arrays with overlapping values.

🔗The challenge is at https://edabit.com/challenge/ERmrS3QrK7sEt4PAt .

🤏Congratulations to the Edabit user who solved it in two lines with a recursive function!
